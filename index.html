        A little about me: <br>
        My name is Gabriel Holmquist, I am often described by others as an "Artist" or "Creative Savant".
         I frequently am working on small 3D modeling, animation, photography, Gundam Kit, Cooking,
          or Automotive Projects. I like to learn a variety of things, but have more recently looked into
          the qualification of a Technical Artist as I both like working with the front and backend of applications
          like programming websites and working on Video games. I find a lot enjoyment in the UI/UX in tandem
          with the back end elements of setting up a server or learning how to otherwise program and realize ideas I have.
          I usually prefer breaking away from a team after coming up with ideas, I like the environment of getting excited
          about a feature or Projects. However, I need the space to think about how I would approach problems and solutions 
          so I can be efficient when it comes to writing code, modeling something, or even working on a model kit.
